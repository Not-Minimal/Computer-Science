Gain knowledge of the basics of algorithms and data structures. A better understanding of real-life algorithms will also help you nail your job interviews.
## Track overview

- **19 hours** for all learning activities **4 weeks** to complete the track if you study 5 hours a week
- **77 topics** with theory and practice adapted to your level
- Certificate of completion **isn’t available** on this beta track
- **Self-paced track.** Learn at your own pace

## What you'll do:

What does a programmer need to know? Of course, programming languages, packages, and frameworks. However, these are just tools that almost anyone can master. To be a successful specialist, you also need to understand the theory. The track has no direct connection with programming languages and contains no projects – only theory topics and tasks for practice. 

You will:

- discover what algorithms and data structures are and how you can represent them;
- get familiar with the basic principles and techniques for designing algorithms;
- explore the basic data structures and their properties;
- learn how to solve sorting, searching, and shortest path problems with popular tools;
- handle and manipulate strings; 
- compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
