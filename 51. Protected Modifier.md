As you may remember, an access modifier describes who can use your piece of code. There are 4 of them in Java:

- `private`: available only for the class itself;
    
- `default`: available for classes from the same package **package-private**
    
- `protected`: available for classes from the same package and the extending classes.
    
- `public`: available from everywhere;
    

We've already considered most of them, but there's the most interesting one left: the `protected` access modifier. Let's place it among the modifiers you already know:

![Access Modifiers](https://ucarecdn.com/ce702533-fd2b-45f4-a605-a53261bef3cb/)

This modifier determines that only subclasses and any classes from the same package can use a class member. A top-level class, which is a non-nested independent class defined in a `.java` file, cannot be protected, but an inner one can be declared this way. This is where the importance of a proper package decomposition comes in.

Now let's discuss the difference between `protected` and its scale neighbors, `private` and **package-private** (`default`).

##### Protected vs default

You can think of classes from the same package as the neighbors and subclasses as the children of a particular class. There are some things you can share or do with your neighbors, for example, discuss a maintenance plan or share the basement. These things and actions would be package-private (`default`).

There are also things you can do for children and close friends, like borrow some money or go for a walk in a park on Sunday. These things will be `protected`.

##### Protected vs private

This distinction is even easier: if a variable, a method, or an inner class is used only by the class itself, then it is `private`, otherwise, it is `protected`. Following the main rule:

Use the most restrictive access level that makes sense for a particular member.

If you're not sure whether the method is useful for other classes, it’s better to first make it private and expand its availability later if needed.

##### Example

Now let's see how all of this works in practice. In the example below, the package `org.hyperskill.bluetooth` has three classes: `Laptop`, `SmartPhone`, and `SmartWatch`. All the gadgets in the package can be connected via Bluetooth. `Laptop` has a method `receiveInfo()`, responsible for getting any information from connected gadgets.

```java
package org.hyperskill.bluetooth;

public class Laptop {

    private String info;

    void receiveInfo(String info) {
        this.info = info;
    }

}
```

The `Laptop` class has only a single field `info` which is not directly accessible since it is declared as private. But all classes from the same package can access it invoking the `receiveInfo` method which is declared as package-private (no modifier).

We consider that `SmartPhone` and `SmartWatch` classes extend the same `MobileGadget` class with the `printNotification` method:

```java
package org.hyperskill.bluetooth;

public class MobileGadget {

    protected void printNotification(String data) {
        System.out.println(data);
    }
}
```

The `printNotification` method is accessible for all subclasses of this class as well as for all classes in the same package (including the `Laptop` class).

The `SmartPhone` class can access the `receiveInfo` method of the `Laptop` class and the `printNotification` method of the `MobileGadget` class.

```java
package org.hyperskill.bluetooth;

public class SmartPhone extends MobileGadget {

    private Laptop connectedLaptop;

    public SmartPhone() {
        this.connectedLaptop = new Laptop();
    }

    private void sendInfoToLaptop(String info) {
        printNotification("Sending info to laptop : "  + info);
        connectedLaptop.receiveInfo(info);
    }
}
```

The `SmartWatch` class has a private method `countHeartRate`, which is not available from other classes (even from a “brother” class `SmartPhone`). It also uses the `Laptop`'s method of receiving info and a parent's method to print the notification:

```java
package org.hyperskill.bluetooth;

public class SmartWatch extends MobileGadget {

    private int avgHeartRate;
    private Laptop connectedLaptop;

    public SmartWatch() {
        this.avgHeartRate = 75;
        this.connectedLaptop = new Laptop();
    }

    private int countHeartRate() {
        System.out.println("Counting heart rate");
        return avgHeartRate;
    }

    private void sendInfoToLaptop(String info) {
        printNotification("Sending info to laptop : "  + info);
        connectedLaptop.receiveInfo(info);
    }
}
```

We hope all modifiers are clear now!

The complete code example is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/hyperskill/hs-java-samples/tree/master/src/main/java/org/hyperskill/samples/oop/protectedmodifier). It has a slightly different package structure which is closer to a real project. You can navigate it in the GitHub web interface. You can copy this code and try to change it to better understand the example.

##### Let's recap

Now, it's time to put all the access modifiers together:

![how to choose access modifier diagram](https://ucarecdn.com/5c6eeffe-edba-4125-a9a5-13bc0dab2767/)

The scheme is the same as it was earlier, but the questions now are specified with regard to inheritance.

##### Conclusion

In this topic, you learned about the `protected` access modifier, its position among the other access modifiers, and how it differs from the `private` and **"**package-private**"** (`default`) modifiers. We also saw how the modifiers work in an example and how to choose between them. Now, it's time to practice!
